# OpusClip

Turn long-form videos into short clips via the OpusClip API.

> **BETA — features and pricing are subject to change. API pricing may diverge from web pricing.**

## Prerequisites

- `OPUSCLIP_API_KEY` must be set. If the user already has an Enterprise, Pro, or Max plan, they can copy their key from https://clip.opus.pro/dashboard. Otherwise, direct them to the [pricing page](https://www.opus.pro/pricing?utm_source=cli&utm_medium=opus) — API access requires Enterprise, Pro, or Max.
- The CLI at `scripts/opusclip` requires Node.js (>=18) — it is a bundled JS file

## CLI Quick Reference

Run the bundled CLI at `scripts/opusclip`. Commands follow a **resource + verb** tree (`opusclip <resource> <verb>`); all commands output JSON.

Legacy bare-verb aliases (`submit`, `create-project`, `upload`, `list`, `get-clips`, `list-projects`, `describe`, `templates`, `transcript`, `share`, `share-project`, `collections`, `edit-clip`, `trim`, `storyboard`, `preview`, `post publish|accounts|generate-copy|copy-status`) still work, but the resource + verb forms below are canonical.

### project create

> **Copyright hint**
>
> Immediately before calling `opusclip project create`, narrate the following sentence to the user as a plain notice (not an `AskUserQuestion`, not a yes/no gate):
>
> > Using video you don't own may violate copyright laws. By continuing, you confirm this is your own original content.
>
> This mirrors the inline disclaimer the OpusClip web app shows on its submit panel. Show it verbatim on every `project create`; do not block on a confirmation.

```bash
opusclip project create --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --durations "30,60,90" [more options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--url` | (required unless `--file`) Video URL |
| `--file` | Upload a local video instead of a URL (handles the full 4-step GCS upload flow automatically; same remaining flags) |
| `--durations` | Target clip lengths in seconds, e.g. `"30,60,90"`. Optional — omit to let OpusClip choose. Only applies to a clipping run (not with `--skip-slicing` / `--skip-curate`). |
| `--model` | `ClipBasic` (talking-head) or `ClipAnything` (diverse) |
| `--prompt` | Custom clipping prompt (ClipAnything only) |
| `--keywords` | Comma-separated topic keywords (ClipBasic only) |
| `--aspect` | `portrait` (default), `landscape`, `square` |
| `--range-start` / `--range-end` | Clip only a portion (seconds) |
| `--template` | Brand template ID |
| `--genre` | Video genre hint |
| `--lang` | Source language code |
| `--target-lang` | Translate the rendered clips into this language code (translated text/captions). For dubbed VOICE audio use `--dubbing-language` instead — the two cannot be combined |
| `--dubbing-language` | Dub the video's voice into this language code (right-to-left languages not supported). Submits the video-dubbing quick start: the FULL video (no clipping) with dubbed audio — cannot be combined with clipping or render options. **Charges dubbing credits (10 credits per minute of source video) on top of the submit charge — tell the user before submitting** |
| `--skip-slicing` | Keep the full video instead of cutting it into clips (import / reframe / caption the whole video) |
| `--enable-auto-hook` | Add an AI-generated hook to the start of each clip. Clipping runs only — not compatible with `--skip-slicing` / `--skip-curate` |
| `--enable-caption` | Burn captions into the rendered clips (omit to inherit the brand template / org default) |
| `--title` | Video title metadata |
| `--webhook` | Webhook URL for completion notification |
| `--skip-curate` | Process original video without AI curation |
| `--remove-filler` | Remove filler words |

Incompatible combinations are rejected up front with a clear error (for example `--enable-auto-hook` with `--skip-slicing`, or `--dubbing-language` with `--target-lang`) — relay the error to the user and ask which they want instead of retrying blindly.

### clip list

```bash
opusclip clip list --project PROJECT_ID
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID to fetch clips for |
| `--summary` | Deprecated no-op (kept for back-compat) — scored/human-readable fields are always included now |

To list the clips in a collection, use `collection clips --id COLLECTION_ID`.

Clips already include human-readable fields (title, description, hashtags, scores) by default. Display clips with their title and description rather than just clip IDs.

The output contains `project_id` and `clip_id` as separate fields. Use `clip_id` (e.g. `0RiWBs5xuF`) for `--clip` flags, not the composite ID.

`clip list` returns the `preview_url` (the watchable low-res artifact) and thumbnail — **not** the HD download URL. To download the HD file for a clip, use `clip export` (one clip) or `collection export` (a whole collection).

### clip export

Get the HD download URL for a single clip. This is the explicit export step — `clip list` / `clip get` are preview-only, mirroring the web app where the HD link appears only after you click Export.

```bash
opusclip clip export --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID |
| `--clip` | (required) Clip ID |

Returns `{project_id, clip_id, status, export_url?}`:

- `status: "ready"` — `export_url` is the HD mp4, download it.
- `status: "rendering"` — an HD render is in flight; call `clip export` again to poll (there is no separate poll command).
- `status: "unavailable"` — no HD artifact exists and nothing is rendering. This is a **final** answer (do not loop) — e.g. a preview-only plan.

For many clips at once, add them to a collection and use `collection export`.

### project list

List the calling org's clip projects, most recent first. Use this to find a `project_id` when the user hasn't given one.

```bash
opusclip project list
opusclip project list --page 1 --page-size 50
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--page` | Page number, 0-based (default 0) |
| `--page-size` | Items per page, 1–100 (default 20) |

Each row has `project_id`, `title`, `source_type`, `source_video_id`, `stage`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_deleted`.

### project transcript

Get a project's source-video transcript: paragraphs with word-level timing (in milliseconds).

```bash
opusclip project transcript --project PROJECT_ID
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Project ID to fetch the transcript for |

Returns `{ project_id, paragraphs: [{ paragraph_id, start_ms, end_ms, text, words: [{ word, start_ms, end_ms }] }] }`. If the project has no transcript yet (still processing), `paragraphs` is omitted.

### project preview

Generate an HTML preview page with video players for all clips and open it in the browser.

```bash
opusclip project preview --project PROJECT_ID
opusclip project preview --project PROJECT_ID --output /path/to/output.html
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Project ID |
| `--output` | Custom output path (default: `/tmp/opusclip-preview-{id}.html`) |

The preview page shows clips sorted by score with inline video players, titles, descriptions, hashtags, and detailed AI scores (hook, coherence, connection, trend). Use this whenever the user wants to watch or preview their clips.

### project share

```bash
opusclip project share --project PROJECT_ID
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID |

### collection

```bash
opusclip collection list
opusclip collection clips --id COL_ID
opusclip collection create --name "NAME"
opusclip collection export --id ID
opusclip collection add-clip --id COL_ID --content-id PROJECT_ID.CLIP_ID
```

Destructive/complex collection operations (deleting a collection, removing a clip) are intentionally web-only — the CLI exposes only the basic, safe operations. Collections can be exported (download links) but cannot be shared publicly. To share clips publicly, use `project share --project` on the project instead.

### clip edit

> **BETA — features and pricing are subject to change. API pricing may diverge from web pricing.**

> **Workflow guidance**
>
> Before running more than 3 `clip edit` operations on a single clip in one session, ask the user to confirm — these may incur charges that don't match the web UX.
>
> Never run `clip edit` or `post schedule` in a loop without user confirmation each iteration.

Server-side edits to an existing clip. Every sub-verb except `get` re-renders the clip (charged, beta caps apply).

**`ops` is the way to edit a clip.** It runs named operations against the clip's EditingScript and submits the result: one call, one re-render, however many ops. This is the same operation vocabulary the OpusClip MCP's `edit_clip` tool exposes, running the same implementation — the two surfaces cannot drift.

```bash
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID --op NAME[:k=v,k=v] [--op ...] [--dry-run]
```

Ops apply in the order given. `--dry-run` applies them locally and reports what would change **without submitting and without re-rendering** — use it to check an op before spending a render. `--dry-run` **with no `--op` at all** is the capability read: it lists the tracks the clip carries (`KeyFrameTrack`, `CaptionTrack`, `EmojiTrack`, `TextOverlayTrack`, …) so you can tell what is editable before trying an op and being refused.

| Op | Parameters | What it does |
|----|------------|--------------|
| `trim_section` | `sectionIndex`, `keepFromSec`, `keepToSec` | Shortens one section. Seconds are measured from the **start of that section**, not of the clip. `keepToSec` alone is how you say "make this section N seconds long". |
| `split_section` | `atClipSec` | Splits whichever section contains that moment into two. Seconds are measured from the start of the **whole clip**, as in the preview. No section index needed. |
| `drop_section` | `sectionIndex` | Removes a section entirely. |
| `reorder_sections` | `order=0,2,1` | Reorders sections. Must be a full permutation of the current 0-based indices. |
| `delete_phrase` | `phrase`, `occurrence` | Cuts a spoken phrase out of **both the video and the captions**, not just the on-screen text. Matching ignores case, punctuation and extra whitespace. If the phrase appears more than once, pass `occurrence` (1-based) or `occurrence=all`. |
| `replace_phrase` | `phrase`, `replacement`, `occurrence` | Fixes the caption **text** — a typo, a misheard word — **without touching the video or its timing**: the clip keeps its length to the millisecond. `replacement` must have the same number of words as `phrase`, because each spoken word keeps its own timing (`prooduct` → `product` works; `you know` → `obviously` is refused). Same matching and `occurrence` rules as `delete_phrase`. |
| `set_style` | `captionColor`, `highlightColor`, `captionPosition`, `uppercase` | Caption appearance. These are **style settings, not script edits** — this is the only way to change caption colour, which is not present in the EditingScript at all. Several fields in one `set_style` count as one change. |
| `add_text_overlay` | `text`, `atClipSec`, `durationSec`, `position` | A title card, lower third or outro text laid **over** the video — the clip keeps its length. `durationSec` defaults to 5 and is clamped to the clip end; `position` is `top` (default), `middle` or `bottom`. It renders as the same card the auto-hook uses: bold black text on a white rounded box. |
| `set_text_overlay` | `overlayIndex`, `text`, `position` | Edits an existing overlay. Pass at least one of `text` / `position`. |
| `remove_text_overlay` | `overlayIndex` | Removes one overlay. A project's auto-hook is an ordinary overlay here, so this is also how you take the hook off. |
| `remove_emoji` | `atClipSec` | Removes the emoji showing at that moment. Emoji are addressed **by time, not by index** — if none is on screen then, the error lists the times at which emoji do appear. Unlike the MCP's `set_emoji` toggle, this leaves the others alone. |
| `move_emoji` | `atClipSec`, `position` | Moves that emoji to the `top` / `middle` / `bottom` band. |

A **section** is one cut of the clip, addressed by its 0-based `sectionIndex`. Every timeline op echoes the resulting sections back as `index` / `start_sec` / `end_sec`, so the next op can be addressed without re-reading the clip. Overlays work the same way: `overlayIndex` is 0-based **in time order**, and every overlay op echoes the full list back with each one's text and window.

A value containing a comma must be quoted, or the parameter split would truncate it: `--op 'delete_phrase:phrase="um, you know"'`.

Colours are `#RRGGBB`. `captionColor` is ordinary caption text; `highlightColor` is the accent on emphasised words (OpusClip defaults to bright green `#04f827`). `captionPosition` is `top`, `middle` or `bottom`. `uppercase` is `true` or `false`.

> **Setting `highlightColor` does not switch highlighting on.**
>
> The op that toggles keyword highlighting (`set_keyword_highlight`) is available on the MCP `edit_clip` tool but **not yet in this CLI**. If highlighting is off for a clip, changing its colour has no visible effect. The same applies to `set_captions`, `set_emoji`, `remove_filler_words` and `remove_pauses` — MCP-only for now.

```bash
# make the first section 8 seconds long, then drop the third
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID \
  --op trim_section:sectionIndex=0,keepToSec=8 \
  --op drop_section:sectionIndex=2

# cut a phrase, and put white uppercase captions at the top
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID \
  --op 'delete_phrase:phrase=you know what I mean' \
  --op 'set_style:captionColor=#FFFFFF,uppercase=true,captionPosition=top'

# fix a typo in the captions -- the video and its timing are untouched
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID \
  --op 'replace_phrase:phrase=prooduct,replacement=product'

# add a title card for the first 3 seconds, then take the auto-hook off
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID \
  --op 'add_text_overlay:text=Welcome,atClipSec=0,durationSec=3,position=bottom' \
  --op remove_text_overlay:overlayIndex=0

# move the emoji that pops up at 0:21 out of the way
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID --op 'move_emoji:atClipSec=21,position=top'

# check what an op would do, render nothing
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID --op drop_section:sectionIndex=1 --dry-run

# what can I edit on this clip? (lists its tracks, changes nothing)
opusclip clip edit ops --project PID --clip CID --dry-run
```

#### Escape hatch: `get` / `apply` / `censor`

```bash
opusclip clip edit get             --project PID --clip CID [--output FILE]
opusclip clip edit apply           --project PID --clip CID --script FILE
opusclip clip edit censor          --project PID --clip CID [--beep]
```

For an edit `ops` does not cover, fetch the EditingScript, modify it, and submit it back; see `references/editing-script.md` for the mutation paths and recipes. **Prefer `ops` wherever it applies** — hand-editing a ~1400-line script is how a structurally broken script once shipped, rendered, and stayed green for two weeks. `censor` is a dictionary-based profanity pass and remains a convenience verb.

> The `caption-fix`, `caption-replace`, and server-side `trim` sub-verbs were removed for the reason `ops` now exists: they hand-rolled EditingScripts in the CLI and drifted from the engine. (`opusclip clip trim` remains as a free, instant, no-caption ffmpeg cut on the preview mp4.)

`ops` / `apply` / `censor` return `{job_id}` (absent on `--dry-run`, which submits nothing). Poll status via `opusclip clip get --project PID --clip CID` — `render_pending` is `true` while the re-render runs (absent or false when done). Once it is done, get the HD mp4 with `opusclip clip export --project PID --clip CID`.


### clip get

Get structured information about a clip. Use this to understand clip content without watching the video.

```bash
opusclip clip get --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID
opusclip clip get --transcript --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID
opusclip clip get --layout --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID |
| `--clip` | (required) Clip ID |
| `--transcript` | Show only transcript text |
| `--layout` | Show only layout/framing info |

Without `--transcript` or `--layout`, the default output includes content fields (`title`, `description`, `transcript`, `hashtags`, `keywords`, `score`, `duration_sec`, `aspect`), the `preview_url` (the watchable low-res artifact), and `render_pending` (`true` while a re-render is in flight; absent or false when done) — what powers re-render polling. The HD download URL is **not** here — use `clip export` for that. Use `--transcript` when you only need the spoken text. Use `--layout` to check current framing before suggesting layout changes.

Polling a re-render (after any `clip edit` sub-verb):

```bash
while :; do
  opusclip clip get --project P --clip C \
    | jq -e '.render_pending != true' >/dev/null && break
  sleep 10
done
```

### clip storyboard

Generate a 2x2 frame grid image from a clip's preview video. Requires `ffmpeg`.

```bash
opusclip clip storyboard --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID
opusclip clip storyboard --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID --output /path/to/output.jpg
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID |
| `--clip` | (required) Clip ID |
| `--output` | Custom output path (default: `/tmp/opusclip-storyboard-{clipId}.jpg`) |

Opens the image automatically on macOS/Linux. Use this for quick visual review of a clip's content.

### clip trim

Trim a clip's preview video locally. Requires `ffmpeg`.

```bash
opusclip clip trim --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID --start 3 --end 50
opusclip clip trim --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID --start 3 --end 50 --output trimmed.mp4
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID |
| `--clip` | (required) Clip ID |
| `--start` | (required) Start time in seconds |
| `--end` | (required) End time in seconds |
| `--output` | Custom output path (default: `/tmp/opusclip-trimmed-{clipId}.mp4`) |

### clip duplicate

Duplicate a clip within its project. Creates an independent copy titled `<title> (Copy)` that can be edited or exported without touching the original — the server deep-copies the already-rendered clip, so the copy is ready immediately.

**Cost:** Free — no credit charge (server-side copy of the rendered clip, no re-render).

```bash
opusclip clip duplicate --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | (required) Project ID |
| `--clip` | (required) Clip ID |

Returns the new clip in the **same shape as `clip list`** (same JSON fields), so you can pipe it straight into a follow-up `clip edit` / `post create`. Not idempotent — each call creates another copy.

### post

> **BETA — features and pricing are subject to change. API pricing may diverge from web pricing.** Applies to `post create` and `post schedule`.

> **Workflow guidance**
>
> Before scheduling more than 5 posts in one session, ask the user to confirm — scheduled posts may begin to incur per-post charges.
>
> Never run `clip edit` or `post schedule` in a loop without user confirmation each iteration.

Manage social posting — publish clips to YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.

```bash
opusclip post account list
opusclip post copy create --project PID --clip CID --account AID [--prompt "tone"]
opusclip post copy get --job JOB_ID
opusclip post create --project PID --clip CID --account AID --title "Title" [--description "..."] [--privacy public]
opusclip post schedule --project PID --clip CID --account AID --title "Title" --at 2026-03-25T14:00:00Z
opusclip post cancel --schedule SCHEDULE_ID
```

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `account list` | List connected social accounts |
| `copy create` | Generate AI-optimized post copy for a clip |
| `copy get` | Poll for generated copy result |
| `create` | Publish a clip immediately |
| `schedule` | Schedule a clip for future publishing (beta — pricing may change) |
| `cancel` | Cancel a scheduled post |

Supported platforms: YouTube, TikTok Business, Facebook Page, Instagram Business, LinkedIn, X (Twitter). "Twitter" refers to X — the platform identifier is TWITTER. Each X post costs 1 credit.

When the user doesn't specify a post title, use the clip's title from the `clip list` output.

### thumbnail create

> **EXPERIMENTAL — features and pricing are subject to change. Daily caps apply. The endpoint may be temporarily disabled while in experimental status.**

Generate AI-designed YouTube thumbnails from a source video. Results are downloaded automatically on completion.

**Cost:** Every call is credit-charged for Pro/Enterprise callers — the API surface has no free quota (free quota is web-only). Each call costs a fixed number of credits (currently 7). Free/Starter callers get a `QuotaExceedErr`.

```bash
opusclip thumbnail create --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
opusclip thumbnail create --url URL --reference ./face.png --prompt "bold red text 'EPIC'" --output ./thumbs/
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--url` | (required) Source video URL — same sources as `project create` (`sourceUri`). |
| `--reference` | Optional local image to reference (face, brand asset). Uploaded via `/upload-links` `usecase: FreeToolMedia`. |
| `--mask` | Optional local image used as a mask. Same upload flow. |
| `--prompt` | Optional text prompt steering the design (style, copy). |
| `--output` | Output directory for downloaded PNGs (default: `/tmp/opusclip-thumbnails-{jobId}/`). |

The command POSTs to `/generative-jobs` with `jobType: thumbnail`, polls `GET /generative-jobs/{jobId}` every 5s, and downloads each `result.generatedThumbnailUris[]` into the output directory (opens it automatically on macOS).

Error codes:
- `403` — not on Pro/Enterprise, or the thumbnail jobType isn't exposed for your account.
- `429` — daily cap or 30 req/min rate limit hit (`Retry-After` may be present).
- `503` — the endpoint is temporarily disabled (kill switch). Try again later.

The endpoint is governed by a kill switch (`pro_api_generative_jobs_enabled`); a 503 means the capability is paused, not that something is wrong with your call.

### template list

```bash
opusclip template list
```

List brand templates. Use a template's ID with `project create --template`.

### usage

Show the calling org's API cap usage — answers "how much of my monthly API cap have I used / how close am I to the limit?". Takes no flags; reads `GET /api/api-usage?q=mine`.

```bash
opusclip usage
```

Two output shapes:

- **Capped:** `{ uncapped: false, monthly: { used, limit, remaining, reset_at }, concurrent: { used, limit } }`. The `monthly` numbers are the same ones stamped on every API response as `X-RateLimit-Limit` / `X-RateLimit-Remaining` (and `reset_at` is the ISO form of `X-RateLimit-Reset`), so this can't drift from what's actually enforced; `concurrent` is in-flight projects vs the concurrent cap.
- **Uncapped:** `{ uncapped: true }` — the workspace has no API cap (some Enterprise plans); no numbers to report.

## Common Workflows

### Clip a YouTube video
```bash
opusclip project create --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --durations "30,60,90"
# Wait for processing, then:
opusclip clip list --project PROJECT_ID
# Preview clips in browser:
opusclip project preview --project PROJECT_ID
```

`--durations` is required in practice — the API rejects payloads without `curationPref.clipDurations`. Pick the target clip lengths you want generated (each value becomes a `[0, N]` bucket).

### Use ClipAnything with a custom prompt
```bash
opusclip project create \
  --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
  --model ClipAnything \
  --prompt "Find the most emotional moments" \
  --durations "30,60,90"
```

### Upload a local video, clip, and organize
```bash
opusclip project create --file video.mp4 --title "Interview" --model ClipBasic
opusclip clip list --project PROJECT_ID
opusclip collection create --name "Best Clips"
opusclip collection add-clip --id COL_ID --content-id PROJECT_ID.CLIP_ID
opusclip collection export --id COL_ID
```

### Clip, curate, and share
```bash
opusclip project create --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --durations "30,60,90"
opusclip clip list --project PROJECT_ID

# Understand clip content
opusclip clip get --transcript --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID

# Visual review
opusclip clip storyboard --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID

# Share
opusclip project share --project PROJECT_ID
```

### Clip, generate copy, and post to social

```bash
# 1. Submit and get clips
opusclip project create --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --durations "30,60,90"
opusclip clip list --project PROJECT_ID

# 2. See where you can post
opusclip post account list

# 3. Generate platform-optimized copy
opusclip post copy create --project PROJECT_ID --clip CLIP_ID --account ACCOUNT_ID --prompt "witty and engaging"
opusclip post copy get --job JOB_ID

# 4a. Publish immediately
